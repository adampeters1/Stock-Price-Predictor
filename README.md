 This is a LSTM Machine Learning stock price predictor + GUI, built as a final year project by only me.
 
 This project was supplimentary to my research and writing into machine learning for my dissertation.
 The intended use is as a demonstration of machine learning applied to finance, and of a recurrent neural network, not as a trading tool.
 
 As such, the program is not financial advice, and should not be relied upon for trading.
 I accept no legal responsibility for anyone using this program to trade, and any losses incured by doing so.
 
 With that in mind, the program is written in Python 3 and uses tensorflow's keras as the foundation for the LSTM implementation, and tkinter for the basic GUI.
 Performance has variation of results, however has shown to have over 50% accuracy, making it better than random chance.
 
 Full detail on this project and methodology can be found in my research paper, which you may recieve by contacting me personally.
